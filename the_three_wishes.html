	<h1>The Three Wishes</h1>
	<h3>
		<p>
			Once there was a woodcutter who lived with his wife in a hut. One day, he sharpened his axe and set out to cut down some branches for his winter firewood. As he entered the forest, he heard a sudden call for help. The woodman rushed to the rescue and quickly reached the spot. He found a tiny old man caught among the thorn bushes. The woodcutter cut away some branches with his axe and set him free.
		</p>
		<p>
			In return for his kindness, the tiny little said, “I know that you are poor and I want to help you. I will give you three wishes. Wish anything that you please and you shall have it.” Without waiting to cut his firewood, the woodcutter hurried. When he reached the hut, he told the good news to his wife. “Oh, how wonderful!” She said. “Let us sit down and think of the lovely we can have with our wishes.” 
		</p>
		<p>
			“I am very hungry,” said the woodcutter. We can talk about our goodluck while we eat.” As soon as the dinner was ready, they sat at the table and began to eat and talk. “We can wish for plenty of money,” said the woodcutter. “We can ask for a house like a palace,“ said his wife. “We can wish to be King and Queen,” said the husband. “We can wish for rich and jewels,“ said his wife.
		</p>
		<p>
			They could not make up their minds what to ask first. Then the man said, “This dinner is not very good. I wish I had a nice big sausage to eat with this bread.” As soon as he spoke, a large sausage appeared on the table. His wife was very angry and kept scolding him. “You silly man! You have wasted one of the wishes! How could you be so stupid? Oh! I wish the sausage was sticking to your nose!” As soon as she said these words, the sausage jumped up and stuck to his nose. In vain they tried to pull it off. It was the man’s turn to be angry. "You silly woman!” He cried. “Why did you make such a wish? I cannot go about with a sausage hanging to my nose! I wish the sausage would go back to the table.”
		</p>
		<p>
			The sausage suddenly dropped to the table. The woodcutter and his wife looked sadly at each other. The three wishes were gone and they were still as poor as ever.
